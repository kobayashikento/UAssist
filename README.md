# courseSelectionWeb
Website that provides a user interface for course selections 

This is a class project for CSC309-Programming on the web which I took in the fall of 2019. Together with Ray Kwan and Kavan Lam
we created a web site that aims to aid the course selection process of university students. Given a list of courses the website
will indicate whether a conflict exsists and is also able create a schedule ensures that least amount of time is spent on campus.

As a group, we created both the front and backend of this website and it made is accessible anywhere on the web using the 
following link http://aqueous-reef-85157.herokuapp.com/

The front end mainly uses html, css, js and, jQuery and the server side was coded using ajax, mongo db and, node.js
